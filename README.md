This is my first repository on GitHub

Hi all!

Although I've been learning to code for almost two years, I still feel quite new to the world of programming. But I'm loving it! I am all for the robot revolution if it reduces the amount of boring administrative tasks I am required to do at work. You can see more of my work at: http://theresagasinski.wordpress.com.
